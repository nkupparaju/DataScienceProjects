New York Taxi Fare Prediction:

For a long time, I wanted to implement whatever I know and learnt about the data science. So, for starters I started with the basic dataset from Kaggle which is called as the New York Taxi Fare Prediction dataset. 

 Used linear regression model to predict taxi fares in New York City based on pick-up and drop-off locations.
 Performed feature engineering, tuned hyper parameters and evaluated multiple models.
 Analysed and visualized data to understand the importance of features and get various insights and patterns.



PROXIMAL POLICY OPTIMIZATION FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT:

The basic idea behind this project was to analyze the Reinforcement learning in the stock market. I wanted to check the usability of this in time series data and I chose the stock market, since stock market has the most unpredicatable data.

Why Reinforcement? 
Since I wanted to build an agent that works well in unpredicatable data/environment. The agent learns by interacting with enviornment and gradually increases the performance by trial and error method and also an assumption that PPO works well in gaming enviornment and testing it in stock market has variability. 

The goal was to make three decisions : BUY,HOLD and SELL.
Dataset used: Apple stock

The accuracy of this model wasn't high since I considered only one data set. 

In order to make this model better and maximize the profit, price data alone isn't enough and further sentiment analysis is required.
