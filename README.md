New York Taxi Fare Prediction:

For a long time, I wanted to implement whatever I know and learnt about the data science. So, for starters I started with the basic dataset from Kaggle which is called as the New York Taxi Fare Prediction dataset. 

 Used linear regression model to predict taxi fares in New York City based on pick-up and drop-off locations.
 Performed feature engineering, tuned hyper parameters and evaluated multiple models.
 Analysed and visualized data to understand the importance of features and get various insights and patterns.
